Homework 
A pull request is a fundamental concept in software development, particularly in collaborative environments where multiple developers work on the same codebase. Here's a concise explanation:

-- A pull request is a request made by a developer to merge their changes from a feature branch into the main branch of a repository.
-- It serves as a mechanism for code review and collaboration, allowing team members to review the proposed changes, provide feedback, and suggest improvements before integrating them into the main codebase.
-- Pull requests typically include a summary of the changes, relevant context, and any associated issues or tasks.
-- Once a pull request is submitted, team members can review the code, leave comments, and discuss potential modifications.
-- After the changes have been reviewed and approved, the pull request can be merged into the main branch, incorporating the new features or fixes into the project.

Pull requests facilitate a structured and collaborative approach to managing code changes, ensuring quality, consistency, and transparency in the development process.
